        <p>
          The Daybreak Program is designed to provide supervision and
          activities for adults with disabilities. Our focus is on community
          integration, teaching independent living skills, and job skills.
        </p>

        <p>
          Daybreak provides therapeutic activities for the elderly, people
          with developmental and mental health disabilities, and survivors
          of brain injury.  Opportunities for learning are offered through
          a variety of subjects and taught in a classroom-like environment.
          These classes include cooking, hygiene, symptom management,
          gardening, spelling, reading, math, money management, group
          processing, arts and crafts, and how to deal with stress.  In
          addition to being educational, social opportunities are available
          as well through interaction with their peers and outings in the
          community.
