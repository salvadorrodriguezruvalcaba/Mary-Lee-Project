              The Daybreak Program is designed to provide supervision and
              activities for adults with disabilities. Our focus is on community
              integration, teaching independent living skills, and job skills.
            </p>

            <p>
              Daybreak provides therapeutic activities for the elderly, people
              with developmental and mental health disabilities, and survivors
              of brain injury.  Opportunities for learning are offered through
              a variety of subjects and taught in a classroom-like environment.
              These classes include cooking, hygiene, symptom management,
              gardening, spelling, reading, math, money management, group
              processing, arts and crafts, and how to deal with stress.  In
              addition to being educational, social opportunities are available
              as well through interaction with their peers and outings in the
              community.
