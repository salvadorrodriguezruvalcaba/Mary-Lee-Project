      Transitional Living Services
    </h1>

    <p>
      The Mary Lee Foundation was innovative in its approach to community-based
      programs for people with disabilities. The Foundation’s development of the
      Transitional Living Services program demonstrated a successful alternative
      to institutionalization. The goal of the program is to provide the support
      necessary to assist a person in maintaining their independence while
      always striving to achieve total independence.
    </p>

    <p>
      This program is for short or long-term care for adults with disabilities.
      It is housed in a 6-unit apartment complex. This allows for our residents
      to be in the least restrictive environment, while still having supervision
      and staff assistance.
