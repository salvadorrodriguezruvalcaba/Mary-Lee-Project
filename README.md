Expectations from service

Expectations from the site

Accessibility

What barriers are there when viewing your site?

Currently our website’s layout is a little dated. There really isn’t a clear visual flow

leaving the user feeling a little lost as to where to click first to find what they’re

looking for.

Program information should be more prominently displayed on the home page.

Some of our users may be visually impaired and could benefit from being able to

change the site’s contrast and font sizes. Additionally, users that struggle with

reading could benefit from an audio aid feature. A tool to translate the page to

Spanish is essential.

Is your site accessible to users of different experience levels, using

different devices?

The site is relatively accessible, however, it can appear a little overwhelming to

those who may not be accustomed to older web design. This can furthermore be

inhibiting to those with disabilities. Currently our site does not format well on

mobile devices. Some users may not have access to a computer and rely solely

on mobile devices to view our website. For individuals with low internet speeds, a

feature that scales down the site, so that it will load faster would be nice (maybe

a compression option? If possible?).

Call to Action

The user should be able to:

- Click on the program or service category to learn more

- Contact the individual program they’re interested in for more information.

administrator. It would be nice for the user to e-mail each program directly

for more information through a form on the site.
